There are 2 types of reinsurance: - Facultative which is negotiated separately for each policy that is reinsured. It is used for higher face amounts and often for rated or declined cases. - Automatic (treaty) where the ceding company and the reinsurer negotiate and execute a reinsurance contract under which the reinsurer covers the specified share of all the insurance policies issued by the ceding company which come within the scope of that contract. 29",

    "text": "INTRODUCTION Access Life is a simplified issue life insurance product offering quick, comprehensive life insurance coverage for insured s between 6 months and 80 years of age, without any need for a medical exam or blood tests. Access Life can provide basic coverage of $10,000 to $100,000 for clients finding it hard to get life insurance. And for clients who are healthier, coverage can be as high as $500,000. Clients complete a three-step questionnaire, qualifying for better premiums and coverage the further they advance. Each step offers more advantages than the one before, such as access to term insurance or eligibility for a higher face amount. However, if the client's state of health does not allow him to qualify at one of these stages, his acceptance is still guaranteed and he can benefit from a protection up to $50,000 ($10,000 for children, $25,000 for people over age 50). 3",

Clients declined in underwriting Whether for medical or non-medical reasons, certain people have trouble getting regular life insurance coverage. Access Life is the perfect solution for these people.

Seniors Seniors believe, often wrongly so, that they can't purchase life insurance due to their age or health. However, they often want to make sure their final expenses are taken care of before they pass away. Although most funeral homes offer pre-arrangements, nothing is better than a life insurance policy that will primarily cover these expenses and also provide an inheritance for the family. 1.1.4.

If immediate family members/first-degree relatives (parents and siblings) are affected by a medical condition, there is a higher risk that the client could present the same condition. There is a higher probability to be diagnosed with some cancers if members of the immediate family had the condition at a relatively young age. Other conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, Multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's Disease in the family history, could also bring an extra risk/rating. ivari remains mindful of our client's possible financial constraints, so while the industry guidelines may be open to ratings in some instances, ivari's philosophy is to instead offer exclusions when needed.
