    "text": "INTRODUCTION\nAccess Life is a simplified issue life insurance product offering quick, comprehensive life insurance\ncoverage for insured s between 6 months and 80 years of age, without any need for a medical\nexam or blood tests.\nAccess Life can provide basic coverage of $10,000 to $100,000 for clients finding it hard to get life\ninsurance. And for clients who are healthier, coverage can be as high as $500,000.\nClients complete a three-step questionnaire, qualifying for better premiums and coverage the\nfurther they advance. Each step offers more advantages than the one before, such as access to\nterm insurance or eligibility for a higher face amount.\nHowever, if the client's state of health does not allow him to qualify at one of these stages, his\nacceptance is still guaranteed and he can benefit from a protection up to $50,000 ($10,000 for\nchildren, $25,000 for people over age 50).\n3"

ACCESS LIFE SIMPLIFIED ISSUE INSURANCE\n1.1 Market\nAccess Life is an ideal option for people having trouble getting regular life insurance.\nAccess Life is also a great product for people who don\u2019t want to go through medical\nexams, either because they don\u2019t have the time or because they think they won\u2019t qualify\nfor regular life insurance.\n1.1.1. Clients declined in underwriting\nWhether for medical or non-medical reasons, certain people have trouble getting regular\nlife insurance coverage. Access Life is the perfect solution for these people. With\nGuaranteed Access coverage, Access Life is the perfect solution for them. No one is\ndeclined.\n1.1.2. Children with a health condition\nAccess Life is also a simplified issue life insurance that provides coverage for children\nunder age 18. Unfortunately, too many children who get illnesses aren\u2019t eligible for life\ninsurance through the normal underwriting process. Access Life provides a solution for\nparents seeking life insurance for these children. Coverage may also be declined or\npostponed due to more common medical problems, such as asthma or ADHD, for\nexample. Access Life can be a great solution for these children, too!\n1.1.3. Seniors\nSeniors believe, often wrongly so, that they can't purchase life insurance due to their age\nor health. However, they often want to make sure their final expenses are taken care of\nbefore they pass away. Although most funeral homes offer pre-arrangements, nothing is\nbetter than a life insurance policy that will primarily cover these expenses and also\nprovide an inheritance for the family.\n1.1.4. Immigrants\nPeople who have recently arrived in Canada often have limited life insurance protection.\nThese clients are eligible for every step of coverage offered under Access Life, based on\ntheir responses to the medical questions on the application. Additional life insurance can\nhelp them pay for the costs of having a funeral in their home country or cover any other\nlife insurance needs that may not be met.\n5"

    "text": "Financial underwriting\nFinancial underwriting is one of the most complex and least-understood aspects in the field. In a contract\nof disability insurance (except for our Universal Loan Insurance), there is a direct relationship between the\nbenefit amount applied for and the applicant\u2019s earned income. Therefore, it is very important to establish\nthe earned income correctly.\nWhen assessing the risk for disability insurance, iA Financial Group needs to keep in mind that insureds\nshould not earn more when disabled than they would if they were working full-time. Otherwise there\nwould be no incentive for the insured to return to work."

By providing all the information up front in the Application, processing\nwill be faster because the underwriter will have everything required to make the best possible decision.\nRemember that while the pocketbook can help you prepare your client for potential ratings, the final\nunderwriting decision may differ once all the factors are assessed. If your client has pending tests or\nspecialist referrals, do not submit an Application yet.\nivari\u2019s critical illness pre-screening checklist\nThe critical illness pre-screening checklist (LP1468) can assist you in a thorough evaluation of the\nproposed insured prior to submitting an Application that includes critical illness insurance.
